<h1 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">More Than What Meets The Eye</h1>
<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)" style="font-family:verdana;" style="font-size:5"> Transformers has by far been my favorite movie, telivision, action figure, and video game franchise.I first got introduced to Transformers back in 2007 when the first live action movie debuted. Ever since, Ive gravitated towards anything with the autobots emblem on. I am heavily interested in the live action films. They are all directed by Micheal Bay a.k.a. " Boom Boom". My favorite movie out of the five is the second installment, The Revenge Of The Fallen.</p>

            <p><img src=http://i.ytimg.com/vi/RK7czu7eRb4/hqdefault.jpg style="width:200px; height:200px;" align=left >The fate of humanity is at stake when two races of robots, the good Autobots and the villainous Decepticons, bring their war to Earth. The robots have the ability to change into different mechanical objects as they seek the key to ultimate power. Only a human youth, Sam Witwicky can save the world from total destruction. A long time ago, far away on the planet of Cybertron, a war is being waged between the noble Autobots (led by the wise Optimus Prime) and the devious Decepticons (commanded by the dreaded Megatron) for control over the Allspark, a mystical talisman that would grant unlimited power to whoever possesses it. The Autobots managed to smuggle the Allspark off the planet, but Megatron blasts off in search of it. He eventually tracks it to the planet of Earth (circa 1850), but his reckless desire for power sends him right into the Arctic Ocean, and the sheer cold forces him into a paralyzed state. His body is later found by Captain Archibald Witwicky, but before going into a comatose state Megatron uses the last of his energy to engrave into the Captain's glasses a map showing the location of the Allspark, and to send a transmission to Cybertron. Megatron is then carried away aboard the Captain's ship. A century later, Captain Witwicky's grandson Sam Witwicky (nicknamed Spike by his friends) buys his first car. To his shock, he discovers it to be Bumblebee, an Autobot in disguise who is to protect Spike, who possesses the Captain's glasses and the map engraved on them. But Bumblebee is not the only Transformer to have arrived on Earth - in the desert of Qatar, the Decepticons Blackout and Scorponok attack a U.S. military base, causing the Pentagon to send their special Sector Seven agents to capture all "specimens of this alien race." Spike and his girlfriend Mikaela find themselves in the midst of a grand battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons, stretching from Hoover Dam all the way to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, deep inside Hoover Dam, the cryogenically stored body of Megatron awakens.</p>

However, Sam Witwicky discovers a conspiracy by the Decepticons who plot to use it for their own evil purposes. And Optimus Prime finds that they are up against a menace who plans to also use it to enslave humanity in order to restore Cybertron.Witwicky and his new girlfriend, Carly, join the fray when the evil Decepticons renew their longstanding war against the Autobots.
